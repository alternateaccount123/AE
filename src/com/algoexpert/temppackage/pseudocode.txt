definition of subsequence:
a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence 
by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements 
-a sequence can be exactly the same as the subsequence


initial pseudocode 
-------------------
traverse 
[
-is cur_index contained in set 	
-is current_index ensuring order of elements remained the same 
]

final actual pseudocode
-------------------------        

//traverse
//ensure order of elements remain the same
//is cur_element contained in set
